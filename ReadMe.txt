Ollama is an open source llm (large language model)

The language model that is used in this example is llama version 3.1

This is a sample test using ollama with spring ai to perform chat related or other tasks

Can be executed via browser localhost / postman / any other methods that can be used to call api

Note:
1. The default path requests the AI Model to write a simple landing page in html
2. The second path which is localhost:{path generated}/cities?message="Insert message here" which requests the AI model to look up on the current weather based on the city provided in the message 

Additional Notes
1. The API Url for weather is http://api.weatherapi.com/v1 and the api key is generated based on account generated. If you would like to test it please create an account in the url provided. Thank you.
